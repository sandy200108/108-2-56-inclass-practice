## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
vectorexample<- c (2,6,7)
listexample<- list (2,6,7)

print(vectorexample)
print(listexample)
```

```{r}
c("2020-03-31T13:40:55Z",
  "一芳",
  "2",
  "水果茶")
library(lubridate)
list(
  ymd_hms("2020-03-31T13:40:55Z"),
  "一芳",
  2,
  "水果茶"
)
```

```{R}

library(lubridate)
`小明交易1` <- list(
  ymd_hms("2020-03-31T13:40:55Z"), # Date/Time class
  "一芳", # character
  2, # numeric
  "水果茶" # character
)
print(`小明交易1`)
```
